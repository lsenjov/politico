## Donat Situation Heats Up
Heiner farmers have once again clashed with Donat militia forces on the contested strip, resulting in 4 deaths and 7 injured. Donat casualties are unknown.

While no formal statement has been issued from the Donatian embassy, sources in Donat say the current lack of action can only worsen our strained relations with Donat.

## Public Services Hungry
Hospitals in Gawahir began reducing services today, as funding begins to run low. More prosperous regions are expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.

Union representative Ivo Dahl said in a public statement today "The revolution was mean to remove incompetence from the government, and yet the new one can not guarantee basic services!"

At time of publication, government representatives could not be reached for comment.
