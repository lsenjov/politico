Welcome to the country of Gebovia.

As members of The Party, you will guide Gebovia to a prosperous future, and not at all ruin the nation with contradictory amendments in your own selfish interests. To do this you will propose amendments to the constitution and other documents.

Very recently, the revolution succeeded and you were catapulted into power. Unfortunately, most of the documents were destroyed during the chaos. Nevertheless, this committee will steer the new country of Gebovia.

## Rules
- This document is not able to be modified via pull requests.
- This document is subject to change at any time.
- Failing to adhere to the laws will invoke the full punishment of the law...when it's instituted, anyway.
- My arbitration on an issue is final. If something doesn't go the way you thought it would, there's a reason for it.
- While public conversation and debate should go on issues here on github, there is no rules for or against external communication.
- Each player will be given secret objectives with a point value. These objectives are either fulfilled or not fulfilled, and are not scored until game is over. Unless revealed by the player, a player's secret objectives can not be forcefully revealed.

## Cash

Players each have a slush fund income of at least 2k Marquers per week

The following is a non-exhaustive list of actions that can be performed on other members, for a price. Most events take place just before voting happens.

### Finance
- Smuggle Cash 4k After the price is spent, any amount of cash can be stored safely overseas. The Financial Minister can do this for free.
- Diplomatic Envoy 4k You leave your Ministerial position. Your votes do not count, and any of your pull requests are not voted on until the next week, but you're pretty safe on your Caribbean island for the rest of the week. The Foreign Minister can do this for free.
- Secret Audit 10k Command a secret inspection of another member's finances. You will learn their bank balance. The Finance Minister can perform this for 5k.
- Public Audit 4k As a secret audit, but the member is notified, and everyone sees the result. The audit does not complete until the end of the week after. The Finance Minister can perform this for 2k.

### Surveillance
- Private Surveillance 20k See a member's actions for the week. Internal Security Minister can do this for 10k
- Public Surveillance 8k Everyone sees a member's actions for the week. The member is notified of the fact. Begins at the start of the next week. Internal Security Minister can do this for 4k.

### Force
- Purge 10k. A member of the party has a 50% chance of being robbed, with all their current cash going to whoever performed the hit. The member's votes on the weeks issues are ignored, and the member's pull requests are discarded. If this fails, the target knows who initiated the action. The Internal Security Minister can do this for 5k.
- Trial 6k. Charges are brought against a member of the party in the form of a vote. If the vote does not have two other members vouch for them (not themselves or the accuser), the member suffers the effects of a successful purge. The Ideology Minister can perform this for 2k.
- Exile 8k. A member of the party has the choice of leaving the country for a week (as a diplomatic envoy) or suffer a purge. The Internal Security Minister can do this for 4k.
- Guard 4k. Bodyguards look after a member, preventing purge attempts. The defence minister can do this for 2k.
- Military Coup 100k. Only performable by the Defence Minister. Immediately take power and all ministerial positions for the rest of the week. Purge all members you wish.
